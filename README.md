# Inventory-Professional
About
This code is an effect of the Inventory System Extension for Unity3D.
It will be very friendly for new Unity3D users, because you can control this system right from the Editor, you don't have to write 
any code, until you don't want to extend it by the new functionality.

This Inventory System will contain for example: Item Banks, Vendors, Inventories, Actionbars and a lots of other things you 
will need for Inventory System in your Unity3D Game.

There's a series of blog posts (in Polish) about developing this Inventory System:
